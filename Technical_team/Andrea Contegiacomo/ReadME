I made two pics for the USERS: 2 CEO e 1 Sys Adm.png and Store managers.png. showing different kind of Users as requested.

Then I've uploaded one screenshot for each Object I made: Account.png, Lead.png, Opportunity.png, Product Type.png, Seller.png.
The screenshots are example of what I've done and there aren't ALL THE FIELDS, because there are too many of them. 
Anyway they were created on the org.

The Stock object was removed and other fields updated.

The Opportunity Path.png shows the creation of the path as requested.
